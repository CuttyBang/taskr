# taskr
A task displayer for Asana.
In the interest of time I decided to go old-school with this and use jQuery instead of a framework. The functionality was
simple enough to forgo all that. However, it was so simple that I started to embelish the UI with a nicer layout, then 
deliver the tasks in a way that echoes the "Boards" layout of Asana, then a bit of a copy of the Asana layout....
then why not add a logo?.... 
some animations...
you get what I mean. 
So what started as "simple enough to not need a framework" got detailed enough to probably have benefitted from a framework.
I also opted for the Asana Node client SDK over oAuth simply because it wasn't really meant to get more than my own tasks.
